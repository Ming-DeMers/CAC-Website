# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

## Existing Design (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.

### Existing Site: The Site (Milestone 1)

### Existing Site: Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

The audience of this site are students of Cornell and those interested in learning more about the club. This tends to be photographers and videographers, as well as members and individuals of other clubs or organizations looking to collab with our club. Site visitors likely want to learn more about the club and understand what the club has to offer. This is a cohesive group because they all have a common interest in photography and videography, and are looking to learn more about the club, and are a subset of Cornell.


### Existing Site: Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your existing site's audience's goals. (These should be informed by user research. Not assumptions or stereotypes.)
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: To learn more about Capture at Cornell - it's past and present offerings, what they do, if they want to join.

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
- The design will be a straightforward website that users can view and easily find the information they want. The site will use partials for the header and footer, and will have a navigation bar that users can use to navigate the site. There will also be an events page that can be used to view past and upcoming events, which will be dynamic.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This is necessary for the essence of this website and its usefulness.

Goal 2: To join the club by filling out the quick form, or to contact the e-board.

  - The design will have a form that users can fill out to join the club, and a contact page with the e-board's emails.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This will provide a quick way for users to join the club, and a way for them to contact the e-board.

The home page will contain introductory information about the club, as well as a some images of the club. The about page will contain more information about the club, and the events page will contain a list of past and upcoming events. The contact page will contain the e-board's emails, the ability to send an email to the club in general, and a collab form.
